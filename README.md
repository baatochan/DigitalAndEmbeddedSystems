I tried my best to describe the task description for each labs. Every solution is widely described (:poland:) in the report which is in `/Reports/LabX/`. There are missing reports for last two labs, as we didn't have to do them.

The code was written for ZL-9572 (and the two last labs for Spartan3E). More info can be found [here](http://www.zsk.ict.pwr.wroc.pl/zsk/dyd/intinz/uc/) (:poland:).
