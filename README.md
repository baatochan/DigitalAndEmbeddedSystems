I'm very sorry that I didn't include the task descriptions for those solutions. I just don't have them anymore, nor remember what they were about. I'm pretty sure that nobody will find this repo useful because of that :/

You can just try to understand them on your own as almost every task have simulation and/or schema files ready.

The code was written for ZL-9572 and Spartan3E. More info can be found [here](http://www.zsk.ict.pwr.wroc.pl/zsk/dyd/intinz/uc/).
